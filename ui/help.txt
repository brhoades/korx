  "^1Recent Changes^7"
  {
    "You can view more details at korx.googlecode.com."
  }
  "Sprint / Dodge"
  {
    "Human players will find their old binds for sprinting will no longer "
    "work. Sprinting has been merged with a new Human ability, dodging. You "
    "can bind a key for Sprint and Dodge via the Options menu or bind a "
    "key (\\bind shift +button6). When you are strafing or walking backwards, "
    "press the dodge key to make a quick sideways jump. When running forward, "
    "press the dodge key to start a sprint. The sprint will last until you let "
    "go of the forward key."
  }
  "Infection and Biokits"
  {
    "The Aids system, as it is called, has been changed in KoRx. Bites from "
    "Advanced Dretches cause unprotected Humans to become infected. This "
    "infection causes Humans to take damage every few seconds. The damage "
    "is multiplied when someone who is infected is poisoned, and comes into "
    "contact with someone else is infected, the poison spreads too. The biokit "
    "no longer instantly heals infections, it increases resistance by 75 percent. "
    "The Helmet increases the resistance by an additional 20 percent, and the "
    "Battle Suit by 23 percent."
  }
  "Alien Healing"
  {
    "Alien healing has changed in KoRx. Aliens now heal smoothly instead "
    "of gaining health once a second. If you are standing on creep you will "
    "heal 1.5x as fast as you would normally. You also heal faster when near "
    "a booster or advanced tyrant. All alien healing bonuses stack "
    "so if you are near several than you will get the combined effect. \n"
    "Watch the health cross icon on your HUD to see what your healing rate is. "
    "The icon will glow if you are on creep (<2x healing rate). "
    "Two barbs is 2x, four is 4x."
  }
  "Anti-Camping"
  {
    "Aliens will no longer be as frustrated by camping Human players because "
    "the Adv. Dragoon is now available at Stage 2. The Adv. "
    "Dragoon snipe attack has splash damage. Jetpacks now require power to float, "
    "so aliens do not have to worry (as much) about camping jettards, they have to come down "
    "sometime."
  }
  "Barricades"
  {
    "Nearly useless in 1.1, Barricades now have more health, are cheaper to "
    "build, and will shrink to allow Aliens to pass over them. Acid tubes "
    "will fire from behind barricades, providing a formidable defense. "
    "Experiment with blocking off hallways and building staged defenses, but "
    "keep in mind that low ceilings will prevent Tyrants from returning inside "
    "the base."
  }
  "Human Buildables"
  {
    "The Defense Computer will automatically repair Human buildables. "
    "Tesla Generators can fire over turrets as well. "
    "ForceFields can be lowered by using the Q button. "
  }
  "Human Weapons"
  {
    "Most of the human projeciles have a small volume now, making them more "
    "effective against smaller targets.\n"
    "The Lucifer Cannon projectile can be fired faster but now takes longer "
    "to charge. You will be able to hear your teammates overcharge "
    "their Lucifer Cannon.\n\n"
    "The Flamer projectile now gains more of the velocity of its wielder, "
    "making it easier to chase down aliens without burning yourself to a "
    "crisp."
  }
  "VSay"
  {
    "VSay is a new command from the Tremfusion merge. It comes in 3 different forms: "
    "/vsay, /vsay_team, and /vsay_local. The format is like so: \n"
    "/vsay (what to say) (optional text)\n"
    "With what to say being as2, as3, base, builder, getback, moveforward, rush, grenade, "
    "repair, or followme. Note, if you just use /vsay, everyone will hear it."
  }
  "Lag Correction"
  {
    "While the Tremulous implementation of Neil Toronto's unlagged is "
    "becoming widely accepted, KoRx also implements client-side improvements "
    "not possible in 1.1 servers. For those who insist on leading their "
    "attacks, setting cg_unlagged to 0 will disable backward reconcilliation "
    "on your hitscan weapons."
  }
  "Adv. Marauder"
  {
    "The Adv. Marauder now has a simpler, area-effect electric shock attack "
    "that does not need to be aimed. Use this to attack large groups of Humans "
    "or Human bases. The shock attack also drains human's cloaks and energy weapons. "
    "Additionally it can also launch three barbs at a rapid rate.\n\n"
  }
  "Mark Deconstruction"
  {
    "The deconstruction method (on some servers) has changed. Buildables "
    "are no longer instantly "
    "deconstructed. Instead, a deconstruct mark appears on the health bar. "
    "Go ahead and build a new buildable somewhere else and the old one will "
    "be removed automatically. Buildables that are about to be removed by "
    "constructing the selected buildable glow red. This feature may or may "
    "not be enabled on the server you are currently playing on"
  }
  "Dretch"
  {
    "The dretch bounding box and model have both slightly changed to line up "
    "more closely.\n"
  }
  "Squad Marking"
  {
    "Want to keep track of certain teammates? Mark them as members of your "
    "squad. Bind a key to 'Toggle Squad Mark' (Options -> Misc), walk up to "
    "the target player and press that key. A triangle will appear above them "
    "marking them as a squad member. The triangle will stay on screen as long "
    "as the player is around you."
  }
  "Tyrant"
  {
    "Tyrants can charge for longer periods of time, hit targets multiple times "
    "in a single charge, and crush any Humans they land on top of. Trample "
    "charge does not instantly release when full but can be held for two "
    "seconds. The Tyrant's healing aura has been removed, find a booster, "
    "Advanced Tyrant, or return to your base to heal faster."
  }
  "Boosters"
  {
    "Boosters, as in most recent tremulous servers, provide a 2X healing aura for "
    "aliens. But unique to KoRx, they now poison humans who touch them and provide "
    "antivenin to any poisoned aliens." 
  }
  "Jetpacks"
  {
    "Jetpacks were initially designed, as the developers of KoRx believe, to combat "
    "the wall crawling ability of aliens. This way, humans could get any high bases "
    "aliens built that were traditionally out of reach. However, in most tremulous "
    "servers now, jetpacks are used as portable camp stations, so humans can snipe "
    "out of reach of aliens. Exclusively in KoRx, now the Jetpack requires battery power to "
    "run. The default pwer amount is 180 seconds. It can be obtained at the arm "
    "but also recharges over time, quicker with the RC than without it."
  
  }
  "Cloak"
  {
    "There is an allied cloak system. Just because you can see "
    "your allies when they are cloaked, doesn't mean they are visible to the opposite team. "
    "You can also use the cloak with anything you want, it might show though, you've been warned. "
