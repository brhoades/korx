broken things
-------------

Status of teamscore menu (kills/deaths) is uncertain. need to check on things like score resetting to make sure we have what we want from it.
Pulse rifle alternate fire doesn't work.
Aliens should be able to get poisioned.
Rant acid shouldn't hurt teammates except on direct impact.
Need to make !restart restart cg.time (for skirmish time), uncertain if this would affect other things

to-do list
----------

revamp stage counting system (i've got a plan for this)
Add killing spree/feeding spree patch.
Booster provides antivenom for poisoned aliens(?).
Revamp teamvote system.
Rants should be able to take down a S1 human base in 20 seconds, like a Xael.
	Nerf ret hp? Give adv rant mega hp? Super recharging badass acid bombs?
Finish telenode textures.
Change ckit screen color.
