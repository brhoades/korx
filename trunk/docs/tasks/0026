New feature request:
The jetpack shuold have a fuel limit. For the time being, the fuel
limit should probably only be drained by strafing or rising. It should
be rechargable at the arm only. A charge of 50 or so should suffice,
as anything too high allows people to get up nice and high and idle
forever, and only dodge when they have to.

Later, a gauge like the one on the luci charge can be added to indicate
charge left.
