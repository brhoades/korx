Retroactively added this task. Feature I requested, "Revamp stage counting
system (I've got a plan for this). As it is, I never completely took it upon
myself to understand how the "kills until next stage" is generated. However,
I have noticed some fairly obvious things. First, the amount of kills to the
next stage gets changed based upon how many players are on a team. Second,
this number can be dynamically altered if one team has more players (more
kills required, goes up) or fewer players (less kills required, goes down).
While this sounds reasonable at first, I have played games where this behavior
became nothing more than a hindrance to my team. Say you're s2 and the other
team is s3 yet they have fewer players. You can get kills here and there, but
it seems to take FOREVER for your counter to go down due to the disparity
(increasing kills for you) and that you might be having a hard time getting
kills as it is. My revised system will remove the dynamic changing "kills 
needed" and replace it with a static number of kills. This way, you can be
absolutely certain how many kills will get your team to the next stage.
Earlier, I added a feature called "Skirmish Time" where no kills are counted
towards the next stage until 3 minutes. This works hand in hand with my
revised stage system. More on this in a moment. The way that this system will
work is by performing a calculation at the beginning of each stage based on
the maximum number of people that have been on a given team at any one time.
So the calculation will be performed when skirmish time stops and when you
reach s2. This combined with skirmish time gives you some time to fill
each team before stage counting starts and lets you get some credits or evos
without worrying about feeding the opposing team to a higher stage. I'm
reasoning here that it will reduce (at least initial) camping. Now the other
concern is that there is no dynamic score changing. So if your team had 10
players for most of S1 but now 9 people left your team and it's just you,
and you then reach s2, the s2 calculation will be based upon those 10 players.
You will need to get the number of kills that 10 players would need. Some
might think that this is unusually harsh, but I feel that it encourages
players to stay on a team and finish the game. It also eliminates the
possibility of a bunch of people leaving and rejoining a team right before
the next stage (to have the effect of reducing the required kills for the
next stage after that). One idea I had for a method to calculate the kills
for the next stage is this: players^2/2 + 5 (rounded up). So a team with one
player needs 8 kills to advanced to the next stage and a team with 10 players
needs 55 to get to the next stage. I've included a table below to show the kill
requirements per stage.

Players		Kills Required		Avg. Kills/Player Required
1		6			6
2		7			3.5
3		10			3.3
4		13			3.25
5		18			3.6
6		23			3.83
7		30			4.29
8		37			4.63
9		46			5.11
10		55			5.5
11		66			6.0
12		77			6.4

The result is that teams with fewer players still have a floor of kills
they need to get and teams with more players (starting 5 and going up)
will need more and more kills per player to get to the next stage.
The logic of this is that teams with fewer players will need some kills but
not a large amount and teams with more players will need a lot of kills.
The rationale behind this is that if there are more players on each team,
there will be more opportunities to kill. This document has gone from from
merely being an explanation to a relative thesis.
