Retroactively added this task. Problem was stated as "Need to make !restart
work for skirmish time." To elaborate, as it is, skirmish time stops at 3
minutes into the game and regular stage counting begins. When a level starts,
skirmish time works fine. However, if a !restart is performed, I'm thinking
that the level time is not being reset. So, for example, if you're one minute
into the game and call a !restart, there should be something around 2 minutes
instead of 3 of skirmish time. I need further diagnosis on why it behaves this
way.
