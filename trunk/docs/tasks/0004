Retroactively added this task. The original problem was that the jetpack was
invisible and soundless to anyone except the person who had it. Upon
exhaustive analysis, it was determined that the problem originated in
Trepidus-r147 and was carried into KoRx at import. aaron corrected the problem
in r451. I haven't looked at how this was done but have confirmed that it
works. wire suggests is a problem with the netcode, specifically modelindex
and modelindex2.
