The "current_issues" file tracks Bugs and Wanted Features.
When fixed, issues can have a fixed status of Untested or Tested.
Ultimately we want everything to go into Tested.

PROCEDURE FOR INTRODUCING A NEW BUG OR FEATURE

01. Open /docs/tasks/IDs
02. Go to the bottom of the file
03. Add the next number
04. Tab to next column and add a short description
05. This number is the Task ID you will use when adding the bug/feature to the
    current_issues file (The Task ID is persistent)
06. Save File
07. Open /docs/issues/current_issues
08. Add the bug/feature to the appropriate section.
    Include your name, the Task ID, and a short description.
09. Save file.
10. Create a new file. If your Task ID is 1234, you will be creating and
    editing /docs/tasks/1234
11. This new file is a journal for the given task and you can be as verbose
    here as you like. For each new journal entry, include your name, a blank
    line, and as long as a description as you feel necessary.
    Below is an example of a couple entries:

akane

The machine gun is firing tomatos. Identified the problem in
/src/game/g_weapon.c - seems to have started when r201 was committed.

aaron

It seems you accidentally changed the primary fire function to
G_FireTomato. I've set this back to its proper function and tested it.
Works fine. Commiting for r358.

PROCEDURE FOR SUBMITTING A FIX

01. In the above example, the last line should be the closing journal entry.
02. Open /docs/issues/current_issues and move the relevant entry to the
    FIXED section. As the above example cites r358 as the revision the
    problem should be fixed in, the FIXED section has a column for
    FIX REVISION, and should be filled in as such.

OTHER THOUGHTS

The current_issues file doesn't need to cover every little change made.
Rather, its use (and the /docs/tasks/ journal) are for following the progress
of identified problems or wanted features. It's certainly more than possible
for a revision to identify and fix a problem or add a new feature without
having to make a note of it (as the google source changes page does this
for us).
