This is the primary battle granger commit. At this point, I've tested everything,
and from what I can tell it's up to par. Fox's texture is added, along with 
upgraded attacks and descriptions. I still need to add a stronger spit attack 
(as in more different), but I can expect akane to do something with it, as 
weapons aren't my forte.

Granger sounds were duplicated and added to sounds. I added an extra shader 
in aliens.script for the bgranger, though I doubt it's used. The battle granger
is 1.25x the size of a regular granger, with 25% more HP (if my math is right),
and double the attack strength. It currently costs one evo.

PLEASE keep the order in the constant definitions (PCL_ALIEN_BGRANGER for example) 
moving these causes more issues than it's worth. A hard menu hack would be best 
to display the grangers together. Once again, a job for akane.

I've also made it so the battle granger couldn't be relied on as a defensive S3 builder. 
On top of costing 1 evo, it can only build boosters, overminds, hovels, and eggs. 
Its hitbox is actually 1.2x the original model size, so there's a .05 descrepancy (/me too lazy to fix). 
It still needs a unique icon, which  I'll be adding sometime unless Fox makes one 
(which I can bet he will).

Also, the granger is 1.3 units fast, whatever that means. For comparision, a dretch is 1.4 or so.
