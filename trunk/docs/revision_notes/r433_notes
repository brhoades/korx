game/tremulous.h
	faster granger, 0.8 -> 0.9; still the slowest alien
	faster adv granger, 1.0 -> 1.1; can now keep up with walking goon
		(the "granging to the oldies" videos got them in shape)
	faster dretch/advdretch, 1.3 -> 1.4; was fastest, now faster
	mara barb does 35 damage (originally 40, then 20, now 35)
		for comparison, single goon barb has 110 damage
		3 shots from a mara do 105 total
	mara barb recharge time altered very, very, very slightly
		made it a more round number
data/models/buildables/tesla/tesla_spark.jpg
	rotated, squished, and darkened
data/scripts/tesla.shader
	replaced tesla_bolt.tga with tesla_spark.jpg
data/scripts/tesla.trail
	copied from data-1.1.0 for override
	modified somewhat for appearance

other thoughts:

from looking at the names of the shaders and the like it seems sensible
that they could be renamed to something more uniform
