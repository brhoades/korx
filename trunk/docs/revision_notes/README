If you feel so inclined, this OPTIONAL section is here to document a particular
change or set of changes in detail. There is no set structure though I prefer
to do something like this:

/src/game/tremulous.h
	changed dretch's bite damage to 5000
/src/game/bg_pmove.c
	players now get knocked into the next county when firing the xael

The filename as you can see has a naming scheme of rXXX_notes

Personally, I mainly use this area of the docs if I'm making a bunch of changes
at once, so that it might be comprehensible to me when I'm adding a message
for committing it and so that someone could understand in plain words what
it is that I was trying to do.
