broken things
-------------

Status of teamscore menu (kills/deaths) is uncertain. need to check on things like score resetting to make sure we have what we want from it.
Pulse rifle alternate fire doesn't work.
Rant acid shouldn't hurt teammates except on direct impact.
Need to make !restart restart cg.time (for skirmish time), uncertain if this would affect other things
Retribution always gives 1 evo/credit
Ckit can't switch to blaster / can't heal with build timer

to-do list
----------

revamp stage counting system (i've got a plan for this)
Add killing spree/feeding spree patch.
Booster provides antivenom for poisoned aliens(?).
Revamp teamvote system.
Rants should be able to take down a S1 human base in 20 seconds, like a Xael.
	Nerf ret hp? Give adv rant mega hp? Super recharging badass acid bombs?
	All of the above?
Finish telenode textures.
Change ckit screen color.

tentatively fixed (not tested)
------------------------------

Aliens can now poison each other.

fixed (tested)
