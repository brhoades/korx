Retroactively added this task. Problem was stated as "Can't switch to blaster,
can't heal with build timer" I'm assuming this means that when you're building
something, switching to blaster doesn't work until it's finished. Same deal
with healing. I believe I have observed this myself, in part. I *think* that
I could switch to the blaster, though I had to hit the key to switch a couple
times. I believe that i observed the heal does not work at all while building.
Might need more testing to make sure.

Problem confirmed as originally stated. Looking into it.

Eliminated section of code in g_weapon.c that checks to see if the player has
a structure building and denies healing if they are. Did the same thing for
players. Moving on to blaster switching.

Eventually found the offending section. It was labeled "If we have a charge
don't dissipate it" Well wow, the meaning of that is clear. Next time,
hopefully the author picks something like "If we're building, don't switch
weapons." Though it's possible there is some other meaning in that, I'm
doubtful. Everything seems to work fine.

Also noting that while fixing this, I doubled the speed at which the ckit
heals and halved the HP gained from healing. The effect is that the healing
rate is exactly the same as it was before, but it has more "firings" per
second now. Also added a separate (currently blank) shader definition for
human structures being built (no longer uses the telenode rep_cyl shader)

I have tested this fix and give it a status of FIXED, TESTED. Planning to
submit for r470.
