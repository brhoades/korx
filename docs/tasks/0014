Retroactively added this task. Problem was stated as "Can't switch to blaster,
can't heal with build timer" I'm assuming this means that when you're building
something, switching to blaster doesn't work until it's finished. Same deal
with healing. I believe I have observed this myself, in part. I *think* that
I could switch to the blaster, though I had to hit the key to switch a couple
times. I believe that i observed the heal does not work at all while building.
Might need more testing to make sure.
