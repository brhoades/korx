Retroactively added this task. The problem was that the chaingun's
pseudorandomness for the yaw recoil appeared to move in the fashion of a
bouncing sine wave. I seeded the pseudorandom generator with level.time and
everything seems to work fine now. This fix applies to all weapons with
recoil. Applied in r459.
