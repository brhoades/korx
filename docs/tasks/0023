Bug Fix:
I've noticed in KoRx (classic, we'll call it) that barricades and forcefields
around each other will tend to trigger their shrinking functions. Oddly enough,
at the top of the barricade/forcefield touch function is:

  if( !client || client->pers.teamSelection != TEAM_ALIENS/TEAM_HUMANS )
    return;
    
So someone needs to look into this.
