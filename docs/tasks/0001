Retroactively added this task. The problem encountered was that the rant's
charge meter stayed on full for a little while before the charge was forced.
In r439, the LEVEL4_TRAMPLE_CHARGE_TRIGGER definition was lowered from 3000
to 1000. The effect is that the rant now seems to charge immediately once
the meter reaches full.
