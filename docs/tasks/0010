Retroactively added this task. Problem is vaguely stated as "Status of
teamscore menu is uncertain." What this means is I'm unsure how the game
handles keeping a record of your kills and deaths for connection dropping and
team changes. For that matter, I'm not sure how the game handles keeping
credits/evos. We should figure out exactly how we want to retain these numbers
and, once we establish that, ensure that the game does it.
